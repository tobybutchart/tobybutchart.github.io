                <p>long, long time ago there lived a warrior knight named <i>Drakhelm</i> and he was the bravest warrior in all of the land...</p>
                <p><i>Drakhelm</i> was from <i>Quilldore</i>, a small village with a brutal history.
                    For many years <i>Drakhelm</i> himself had been ruler of this turbulent village until the evil <i>King Krillarg</i>
                    pillaged and plundered his way into the village and onto <i>Castle Quilldore</i>,
                    thus becoming the new ruler of the land. One day Drakhelm found enough courage and might to face the evil <i>King Krillarg</i>.
                    He decided to storm the castle and restore order to <i>Quilldore</i>.

                <p><em>Do you want Drakhelm to enter the castle through the front or the back?</em></p>
